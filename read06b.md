# How do computers work?
 
- it takes input:keyboard , your voice .......
- sotre information: stored in memory the computer processor takes these information , then change it or manipulate it using algorithms which is a series of command, sends it back to the memory again 
- processing the information.
- output the result: might be a text a pictures ....
# what makes a computer a computer?
the four tasks above.

# How information is represented using electricity?
information are representing using zeros and ones.
the Binary number system: just two digit 0 , 1
in binary number system multiply evry digit with 2 not like decimal system which multiply every digit with 10 
## -For example : number 9 in decimal is 1001 in binary we got this result by multiply the first digit with 1 and add to it the result of multiplying the second digit with 2 , then add to it the result of multiplying the third digit with 4 and add the result of the fourth digit with 8

### (1X8)+(0x4)+(0x2)+(1x1)= 9 in decimal .
imagine the numbers are wires when its on there are ones going throw them when its off its value is zeros.
 you cant represent any number in binary.
 but what about text, image , sounds ?
 - text can be represented by number also
 - images can be divided into pixels and these pixels can be represents by number
 - sounds is a group of vibration and every vibration is a waveform which can be represent with number

#### Ones and zeros are the backbone of how all computers input store process and output



# How computers use circuits?
By using logic gates like the:
and , or, nor , adder which convert a tiny signals into websites videos and games.


# The 4 parts of a computer?
- Memory
- CPU: central processing unit 
- INPUT
- OUTPUT

# software and hardware?
which work together to :
- HARDWARE:
**cpu:master ship which control all the other parts of computer.
and its know which circuit to use and when to use them


- SOFTWARE: tells the computer whats to do , and they are now  written in pyhton,  ruby ro  blockly , because binary system is the most basic way to write software.

 Operating system: master program the manages how software uses the hardware of a computer, special ability ,like it is allows you to install program and when to run specific program.
